## 🌿 Git Branching Strategy
- `main` → Production | `develop` → Development | `feature/xxx` → Features
- PR workflow: feature → develop → main
- Branch protection: PRs required, pipeline must pass

## 📍 CURRENT STAGE — Stage 13: Docker + Containerization

### Where We Stopped
```
Completed docker-compose.yml with SQL Server + EShop API services

Completed so far in Stage 13:
  ✅ Module 1 — Docker Fundamentals
       → What is Docker, why it exists
       → VM vs Container
       → Docker Architecture (Client/Daemon/Registry)
       → docker run hello-world (first container!)
       → Containers are lightweight vs VMs

  ✅ Module 2 — Images & Containers
       → Image vs Container (cookie cutter analogy)
       → Docker Hub (pulled hello-world)
       → docker pull aspnet:10.0 and sdk:10.0
       → docker images, docker ps, docker ps -a
       → docker rm, docker rmi, docker container prune
       → Container lifecycle (Created→Running→Stopped→Removed)
       → Image layers explained
       → aspnet:10.0 = 340MB (runtime only)
       → sdk:10.0 = 1.26GB (full build tools)
       → Why multi-stage builds save ~1GB!

  ✅ Module 3 — Dockerfile
       → What is a Dockerfile
       → All instructions: FROM, WORKDIR, COPY, RUN,
         ENV, ARG, EXPOSE, ENTRYPOINT, CMD
       → Layer ordering and caching
       → .dockerignore file created
       → Single stage vs Multi-stage Dockerfile
       → Written multi-stage Dockerfile for EShop API
       → Stage 1: Build with SDK image
       → Stage 2: Runtime with aspnet image
       → Built image: eshop-api:v1

  ✅ Module 4 — Running Containers
       → docker run with environment variables (-e flag)
       → Port mapping (-p 8080:80)
       → host.docker.internal explained
       → docker logs, docker rm -f
       → SQL Server sa account setup (TCP/IP enabled)
       → Container connected to SQL Server successfully!
       → Fixed DB migration (db.Database.Migrate())
       → Fixed Swagger in Production mode


  ✅ Module 5 — Volumes and Data
       → What are Docker volumes
       → Named volumes vs bind mounts
       → sqlserver_data volume created
       → /var/opt/mssql = SQL Server data path inside container
       → Data persists even after container deleted!
       → Defined in volumes: section of compose

  ✅ Module 6 — Networking
       → What is Docker networking
       → Bridge network driver explained
       → eshop-network created
       → Containers on same network talk by service name!
       → sqlserver hostname resolves automatically!
       → Outside world accesses only via exposed ports!

  ✅ Module 7 — Docker Compose
       → What is docker-compose and why we need it
       → Written docker-compose.yml
       → SQL Server service with healthcheck + volume
       → EShop API service with depends_on
       → Docker networking (eshop-network)
       → Docker volumes (sqlserver_data - data persists!)
       → Server=sqlserver (service name as hostname!)
       → depends_on with service_healthy condition
       → version, services, volumes, networks explained

  ✅ Module 9 — Best Practices
       → Non-root user (groupadd + useradd + USER)
       → Security: COPY with --chown flag
       → .dockerignore optimized (IDE, OS, Docker files)
       → Health checks added (Dockerfile + docker-compose)
       → /health endpoint in Program.cs (AddDbContextCheck)
       → curl installed for health checks
       → .env file for secrets (not in Git!)
       → .env.example template for team
       → docker-compose uses env variables
       → Docker image labels (OCI standard)
       → Layer caching optimized (csproj copied first)
       → Multi-stage build verified (saves ~1GB)
```

### Docker Modules Plan

## ✅ Stage 14 — CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)

### Completed
```
✅ build-and-test.yml workflow created

✅ Steps: checkout → setup .NET 10 → restore → build → test
✅ Branch protection rules on develop + main
✅ Pipeline verified GREEN ✅
✅ PR: feature/cicd-pipeline → develop → main merged
```

## 🔜 Upcoming Stages

| Stage | Topic |
|-------|-------|
| 13 | ✅ Docker + Containerization (ACR deferred to Stage 15) |
| 14 | ✅ CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions) |
| 15 | ⏳ Azure Deployment + ACR + Key Vault + Managed Identity |
| 16 | ⏳ Split to Microservices (Product/Order/Customer) |

## 🏢 Real Organization Approach
```
Environments: DEV → STAGING → PROD
Workflow: feature branch → PR → CI checks → merge → auto deploy
Azure: Personal free account ($200 credit + free tier)
Tools: GitHub Actions, Azure CLI, Docker Compose
```

---

## 🛠️ Tools Installed & Verified
```
✅ .NET 10 SDK
✅ Visual Studio 2026 / VS Code
✅ SQL Server 2025 (local)
✅ Git + GitHub account (vikasgage28-dev)
✅ Docker Compose (via docker-compose.yml)
❌ Docker Desktop (uninstalled - office policy)
⏳ Azure CLI (needed for Stage 15)
⏳ Azure Account (needed for Stage 15)
```

## 💡 Key Decisions Made
```
→ Using .NET 10 LTS (not 9)
→ Docker images: aspnet:10.0 and sdk:10.0
→ Multi-stage Dockerfile (build with SDK, run with aspnet)
→ Personal Azure free account for ALL cloud resources
→ GitFlow branching (feature/xxx → develop → main)
→ One feature branch per stage
→ Learning style: Concept first → Analogy → Implement → Verify
→ Docker Desktop removed - office policy - using CI/CD for builds
→ SQL Server 2025 (image: mssql/server:2025-latest)
→ sa account enabled with Password123!
→ db.Database.Migrate() added in Program.cs for auto DB creation
→ Swagger enabled in all environments (not just Development)
→ Non-root user (appuser) runs container for security
→ /health endpoint added with AddDbContextCheck
→ .env file used for secrets (not committed to Git)
→ .env.example template shared with team
→ Docker image labels follow OCI standard
→ Module 8 (ACR) deferred to Stage 15 (Azure)
→ CI pipeline (GitHub Actions) - build-and-test.yml
→ Branch protection rules on develop + main
→ Pipeline must pass before PR can be merged
```
